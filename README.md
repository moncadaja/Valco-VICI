# Valco-VICI
Python interface with a series of functions to operate two position and multyposition valves
This code was intended to be used to control a series of 2-position valves interconnected together by daisy-chaining the control modules and unsing only one serial interface. As a result the serial port numeration has to be changed accordingly.
Another piece of code handles multiport valves. It can send and read messages from the controller.
